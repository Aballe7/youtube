Files to follow allong with the GrowAdept Youtube Golang courses.

The GrowAdept/youtube folder will contain folders named after their YouTube courses, minus the spaces.  Each course folder will contain folders named after YouTube video.  The video folders have the same name as the YouTube video title minus the space, this is so they can be searched for easier.  Sorry, but I am not numbering the videos since I am updating courses with new videos as people bring new topics to cover.  Some of the YouTube videos will not have a folder, as they don't have any necessary resources.
